# Gesture-boot
Using unique human gesture detection to automatically turn on the phone, similar to the face recognition function.This action combined with face recognition and other ways to unlock the phone will greatly increase the security factor of the phone。

size is the resolution of the whole image, (x, y) is the normalized coordinates of the center of the target object for the whole image, (w, h) is the normalized width and height of the bounding box of the target object for the whole image.

dw = 1./(size[0])  
dh = 1./(size[1])  
x = (box[0] + box[1])/2.0 - 1  
y = (box[2] + box[3])/2.0 - 1  
w = box[1] - box[0]  
h = box[3] - box[2]  
x = x*dw  
w = w*dw  
y = y*dh  
h = h*dh
